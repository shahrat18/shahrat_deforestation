# Deforestation Exploration- Project

## 1. Background:
The objective of the project is to use a table that is available online to analyze it and come up with results that will help solving the current deforestation issue around the globe. The dataset is a world bank data set that contains the forest area and land area information by country starting from 1990 to 2006.

## 2. Objectives:
The goal is to analyze how the forest area increasing or decreasing over time and at the same time to figure out in which parts of the world are experiencing major deforestation. There is some regions in the world which have seen much better forestation record than most other part. So the plan will be to follow the same footsteps of those regions to improve forestation worldwide. Following that ForestQuery will share the analyzed data with the responsible organization to raise awareness and take necessary steps.

## 3. Data source and Technology:
ForestQuery has collected the data from World Bank which has three tables. First one is ForestArea which contains the information regarding the forested land and they area measured in square kilometers, second one is Total Land Area which is measured in same way and the last one is countries.

ForestQuery has used SQL for querying purposes to perform the analysis and generate the insights.
